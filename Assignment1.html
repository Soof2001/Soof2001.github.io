      <h2>ASSIGNMENT 1</h2>
      <h5>Week 1.1 - Water</h5>
      <p>The city of Amsterdam wants to host the ‘Paralympics’, an open water swimming event through the canals of Amsterdam. To access the feasibility of hosting the event according to the safety of the parthaking athletes, we have reviewed multiple datasets. Although every dataset has its limitations, we have made a selection to access the water traffic, water quality and a potential location for hosting the event in the canals of Amsterdam.</p> 

      <p>On this webpage we will provide information on the research background, methodology and used datasets for Assignment 1. In the Jupyter source file ‘Assignment1_WB, which can be found in the Assignment 1 Zip File on GitHub, we have structured our code and Python script. These Python codes can be run and reproduced in the Jupyter notebook.</p>
    
      <p>The event can not have an impact on commercial water transport, therefore we had a look at the dataset ‘Waterschappen Oppervlaktewateren IMWA’. This dataset is based on data from all Dutch water boards and provides objects such as surface water body, banks and profile defense. We downloaded the dataset from PDOK as a WMS file, and loaded it in ArcGis. The dataset provided details on all surface waters, commercial water transport routes and canal boat tour routes in the whole of The Netherlands. We clipped this information to the municipality of Amsterdam. The result can be seen in the following map. The orange colour marks the available surface waterways in Amsterdam; the light blue colour highlights the commercial water transport ways which are located in the Ij river; the dark blue lines mark the routes of the canal boats tours; and the dark blue pinpoints highlight the boarding points of the canal boat tour.
