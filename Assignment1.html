      <h2>ASSIGNMENT 1</h2>
      <h5>Week 1.1 - Water</h5>
      <p>The city of Amsterdam wants to host the ‘Paralympics’, an open water swimming event through the canals of Amsterdam. To access the feasibility of hosting the event according to the safety of the parthaking athletes, we have reviewed multiple datasets. Although every dataset has its limitations, we have made a selection to access the water traffic, water quality and a potential location for hosting the event in the canals of Amsterdam.</p> 

      <p>On this webpage we will provide information on the research background, methodology and used datasets for Assignment 1. In the Jupyter source file ‘Assignment1_WB, which can be found in the Assignment 1 Zip File on GitHub, we have structured our code and Python script. These Python codes can be run and reproduced in the Jupyter notebook.</p>
    
      <p>The event can not have an impact on commercial water transport, therefore we had a look at the dataset ‘Waterschappen Oppervlaktewateren IMWA’. This dataset is based on data from all Dutch water boards and provides objects such as surface water body, banks and profile defense. We downloaded the dataset from PDOK as a WMS file, and loaded it in ArcGis. The dataset provided details on all surface waters, commercial water transport routes and canal boat tour routes in the whole of The Netherlands. We clipped this information to the municipality of Amsterdam. The result can be seen in the following map. The orange colour marks the available surface waterways in Amsterdam; the light blue colour highlights the commercial water transport ways which are located in the Ij river; the dark blue lines mark the routes of the canal boats tours; and the dark blue pinpoints highlight the boarding points of the canal boat tour.

      <h4>Water quality</h4>
      <p>We have assessed the water quality of Amsterdam according to literature data and a numerical data set.</p>
      <p>Regarding the literature, the pollution levels of the canals should be assessed to protect the health safety from the participants. According to the study of Van den Tillaart (2017), the water quality of the canals is said to be ‘cleaner than ever’, however, its safety cannot be fully guaranteed. For instance, during the Amsterdam City Swim, where thousands of people swim in the Amsterdam canals, 31% of swimmers that filled in an enquête of the GGD Amsterdam (2016), got gastrointestinal health complaints. More recent studies from the Waterschap Amstel Gooi en Vecht (2023) about the water soil quality, researched three different places in Amsterdam: The Western Islands (including the Bickersgracht, Prinseneilandsgracht, Eilandsgracht, Realengracht, Westerdok), the Kostverlorenvaart and part of the Wittenkade, and the Eastern Islands (including Kattenburgervaart, Wittenburgervaart and Oostenburgervaart). The studies concluded that the sludge layer in the Western and Eastern Islands is seriously contaminated, but additional research is needed. The GGD Amsterdam advices not to swim in these waters. However, the contaminated waterbed has no direct health consequences, but it is better to avoid the waterbed to reduce the substances to stir up from the bottom. </p>
      <p>It can be concluded from this brief literature review that for the Paralympics, the water quality is not optimal and could have potential health effects. Also, activities that stir up the sludge layer should be avoided and it is recommended to avoid swimming along the Western and Eastern Islands due to the contaminated waterbed. </p>
      <p>Next to this, we have used the dataset titled ‘Measurement results of surface water quality research, 2019’ from the Amsterdam municipality, to assess the water quality of specific locations in the Amsterdam waters according to several variables such as Nitrogen and Phosphorus levels. We have downloaded this as a XLSX file, and calculated if the several measuring points do not exceed the minimum pollution levels of the used variables in the dataset. The step-by-step coding can be seen in the Assignment1_WB. It can be concluded from this dataset that there is no swimming location in Amsterdam which fulfills the water quality levels, as every point exceeds at least one of the minimum levels.
